/// However, there's a little catch. As you can see we use `Node<()>` to
/// represent a node of the free list. That's because, first of all, we want to
/// reuse the [`LinkedList<T>`] implementation. Secondly, there's no additional
/// metadata associated to free blocks other than pointers to previous and next
/// free blocks. All other data such as block size or region is located in the
/// `Node<Block>` struct right above `Node<()>`, as you can see in the memory
/// representation.
///
/// The [`Node<T>`] type stores the pointers we need plus some other data, so if
/// we give it a zero sized `T` we can reuse it for the free list without
/// declaring a new type or consuming additional memory. But this has some
/// implications over simply storing `*mut Node<Block>` in the free block
/// content space.
///
/// [`Node<T>`] can only point to instances of itself, so [`Node<()>`] can only
/// point to [`Node<()>`], otherwise [`LinkedList<T>`] implementation won't work
/// for this type. Therefore, the free list doesn't contain pointers to the
/// headers of free blocks, it contains pointers to the *content* of free
/// blocks. If we want to obtain the actual block header given a `Node<()>`, we
/// have to substract [`BLOCK_HEADER_SIZE`] to its address and cast to
/// [`Header<Block>`] or [`Node<Block>`].
///
/// It's not so intuitive because the free list should be [`LinkedList<Block>`],
/// but with this implementation it becomes [`LinkedList<()>`] instead. This,
/// however, allows us to reuse [`LinkedList<T>`] without having to implement
/// traits for different types of nodes to give us their next and previous or
/// having to rely on macros to generate code for that. The only incovinience
/// is that the free list points to content of free blocks instead of their
/// header, but we can easily obtain the actual header.
///
/// I suggest that you check out the following commit, which doesn't have
/// [`LinkedList<T>`], to understand why this method reduces boilerplate:
