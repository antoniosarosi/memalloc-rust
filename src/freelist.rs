/// See [`crate::block::Block`] and [`crate::region::Region`].
/// When a block is free we'll use the content of the block to store a free
/// list, that is, a linked list of _only_ free blocks. Since we want a doubly
/// linked list, we need to store 2 pointers, one for the previous block and
/// another one for the next free block. This is how a free block would look
/// like in memory:
///
/// ```text
/// +----------------------------+
/// | pointer to next block      | <--+
/// +----------------------------+    |
/// | pointer to prev block      |    |
/// +----------------------------+    | Node<Block> struct.
/// | rest of fields             |    |
/// +----------------------------+    |
/// |          ......            | <--+
/// +----------------------------+
/// | pointer to next free block | <--+
/// +----------------------------+    | Node<()> struct.
/// | pointer to prev free block | <--+
/// +----------------------------+
/// |     Rest of user data      | <--+
/// |          ......            |    | Rest of content. This could be 0 bytes.
/// |          ......            | <--+
/// +----------------------------+
/// ```
///
/// Free blocks may point to blocks located in different regions, since _all_
/// free blocks are linked. See this representation:
///
/// ```text
///                   Points to free block in next region       Points to same region
///                +--------------------------------------+   +-----------------------+
///                |                                      |   |                       |

/// | Region | | Free  | -> | Block | | ---> | Region | | Free  | -> | Block | -> | Free  | |

/// However, there's a little catch. As you can see we use [`Node<()>`] to
/// represent a node of the free list. That's because, first of all, we want to
/// reuse the [`LinkedList<T>`] implementation. Secondly, there's no additional
/// metadata associated to free blocks other than pointers to previous and next
/// free blocks. All other data such as block size or region is located in the
/// [`Node<Block>`] struct right above [`Node<()>`], as you can see in the
/// memory representation.
///
/// The [`Node<T>`] type stores the pointers we need plus some other data, so if
/// we give it a zero sized `T` we can reuse it for the free list without
/// declaring a new type or consuming additional memory. But this has some
/// implications over simply storing `*mut Node<Block>` in the free block
/// content space.
///
/// [`Node<T>`] can only point to instances of itself, so [`Node<()>`] can only
/// point to [`Node<()>`], otherwise [`LinkedList<T>`] implementation won't work
/// for this type. Therefore, the free list doesn't contain pointers to the
/// headers of free blocks, it contains pointers to the *content* of free
/// blocks. If we want to obtain the actual block header given a [`Node<()>`],
/// we have to substract [`crate::block::BLOCK_HEADER_SIZE`] to its address and
/// cast to [`Header<Block>`] or [`Node<Block>`].
///
/// It's not so intuitive because the free list should be [`LinkedList<Block>`],
/// it's list of free blocks after all, so it should point to blocks themselves.
/// But with this implementation it becomes [`LinkedList<()>`] instead. This,
/// however, allows us to reuse [`LinkedList<T>`] without having to implement
/// traits for different types of nodes to give us their next and previous or
/// having to rely on macros to generate code for that. The only incovinience is
/// that the free list points to content of free blocks instead of their header,
/// but we can easily obtain the actual header.
///
/// I suggest that you check out the following commit, which doesn't have
/// [`LinkedList<T>`], to understand why this method reduces boilerplate:
/// [`37b7752e2daa6707c93cd7badfa85c168f09aac8`](https://github.com/antoniosarosi/memalloc-rust/blob/37b7752e2daa6707c93cd7badfa85c168f09aac8/src/mmap.rs#L649-L687)
