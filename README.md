# Memalloc

The code I ended up with after researching memory allocators. You can run
the examples as follows:

```bash
# This one goes step by step, press enter for the next step
cargo run --example bump
# This one requests some memory and prints stats
cargo run --example mmap
```

Run the tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run with [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri):

```bash
cargo miri test mmap
```

If you want to start with something really simple, check the source code at
[`src/bump.rs`](./src/bump.rs). The other allocator at
[`src/mmap.rs`](./src/mmap.rs) is much more complicated and implements some
tricks and optimizations, but is well documented. These are the resources I
found the most usefull for writing general purpose allocators:
